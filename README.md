# word Count
Word Count and Median Count 

## What is this about?
This program is my submission for a coding challenge, it consists of 2 parts.

The first part of the coding challenge is it implement a word count which will count words in all the text files contained in a directory named wc_input and output the counts(in alphabetical order) to a file named wc_result.txt, which is placed in a directory named wc_output.

The second part of the coding challenge is to implement a running median for the number of words per line of text. Consider each line in a text file as a new stream of words, and find the median number of words per line, up to that point (i.e. the median for that line and all the previous lines) to a file named med_result.txt,which is placed in a directory names wc_utput.

#How to run the code?

Download the code and run the run.sh" script.

I have created a run.sh script which will automatically load the python code from the "src" directory. It will then read all text files from wc_input directory and then run the analysis and write the output to the files wc_result.txt and med_result.txt in wc_output directory

For any questions, please reach out to me.
